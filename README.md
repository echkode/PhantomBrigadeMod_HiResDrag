# HiResDrag

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) that fixes some problems with dragging an action on the combat timeline for high resolution screens.

It is compatible with game release version **2.1.0**. It works with both the Steam and Epic installs of the game. All library mods are fragile and susceptible to breakage whenever a new version is released.

This mod is for players with screen resolutions that are larger than 1920x1080 and who want to use 100% UI scaling.
